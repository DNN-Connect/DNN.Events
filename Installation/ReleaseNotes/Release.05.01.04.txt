<h3>BUG FIXES</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add support for negative permission setting in DNN 5</li>
	<li>Improved XHTML Compliancy</li>
	<li>Notification email &quot;from&quot; address not using setting in module or 
		event, uses site admin address</li>
	<li>Placing a copy of a calendar on a second page, causes duplicate 
		results returned in My Enrolments</li>
	<li>Bugs in .ics export</li>
	<li>Using '[' or ']' in tooltip title or description causes problems</li>
	<li>iCal export does not support regions with no DST</li>
	<li>Apply ISO 8601 standard for week numbers</li>
	<li>Improve code performance be removing unnecessary DB calls</li>
	<li>Expire events not working?</li>
	<li>Make schedule item creation more reliable</li>
	<li>RSS feed does not point to right tab</li>
	<li>RSS feed does not take note of 'Use Module Container &amp; Skin' setting</li>
	<li>Awaiting approval template is missing</li>
	<li>ImageURL may change when EnrollRoleID is changed</li>
	<li>When a user is enrolled to an Event, the telephone number (taken 
		from the User Profile) does not show up where expected in the Edit view</li>
	<li>If you have a monthly recurring event which takes place on the last 
		Wednesday of the month, and the last day of the month is a Wednesday, 
		the calendar shows the event on the Wednesday before.</li>
	<li>Tokens for URLs do not include domain name when Friendly URLs are 
		switched off</li>
	<li>The timezone is not offsetting against the 
		timezone set in the portal. </li>
	<li>Expiring events does not seem to handle timezones correctly (via the 
		scheduled process)</li>
	<li>Bug in RSS Feed - Detail Page</li>
	<li>Month View No Cell Events show event count when event should be 
		hidden</li>
	<li>In some instances (unclear what particulat situation), the 
		TimeInterval List and Schedule aren't being created for a fresh install 
		on DNN 5.3.x. This is because the upgrade process isn't being called 
		which creates these items. To handle this situation a fallback solution 
		is required which is run on occasional basis. An appropriate location is 
		in the module settings, since these items are only required within the 
		module settings or as a result of visiting the module settings. </li>
	<li>Currently only the initial host user (UserID = 1) will get new event 
		notifications (if they subscribe). In theory all host users should be 
		able to subscribe.</li>
	<li>Corrected wrong subject line used in enrollment mails sent from Event Details</li>
	<li>All day event for next day showed in 'Today' list view. Corrected</li>
	<li>Upgrading with big email templates could cause an invalid length parameter passed to the SUBSTRING function.</li>
	<li>When an enrolment role has been added to an event, and the role is then deleted from the portal, the module would fail when entering edit view</li>
	<li>When an module instance is deleted it is no longer available to be included as a sub-calendar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add support for DNN 5.5.x.</li>
	<li>Add an option to provide a number of attendees to an event.</li>
	<li>Add guests when enrolling</li>
	<li>Recurrences days are 
		now localised</li>
	<li>Added a &quot;quantity&quot; for the event registration, and then of course 
		the Quantity need to multiply the price for the PayPal piece 
		and this does effect the 'seats/quantity' remaining.</li>
	<li>Improved text fragments to be made localisation friendly</li>
	<li>Consolidate TimeZone module settings and TimeZone Update menu option</li>
	<li>Limit number of recurring events generated</li>
	<li>Allow event editor to send custom email to enrolees</li>
	<li>Enable category selection via url, 
		added an option to auto-select a category with a variable in the url.</li>
	<li>Events Month View Select Day: 
		select a date on the calender in month view by clicking on the date</li>
	<li>Raise sub-calendar limit 
		to 1.000 subcalendars</li>

	<li>Added an option to
		send invites out when creating an event.</li>
	<li>Enable tooltip per view type</li>
	<li>The list/day views have now been updated so that no column is 
		mandatory. This gives the flexibility to format as requested here by 
		using the templating capability of the description column. Since the 
		Event Title column also showed various icons (recurrence, importance, 
		notification, enrollment), tokens for these have now been added 
		(recurrenceicon, importanceicon, remindericon, enrollicon) as well as a 
		label and text for notification (reminderlabel and reminder).</li>
	<li>Possibility to mail All Registred Users on Event Creation, 
		there is now an option in the module settings to send an email to a 
		role.</li>
	<li>When entering in new events, or editing 
		existing events, do not allow entry of events that will be immediately 
		deleted (i.e. do a compare with &quot;set expire events older than&quot; entry and 
		perform some form validation</li>
	<li>Currently a fully formatted href is created for the event titles 
		(titleurl) . There is now a token for the basic 
		url available as well, so admins can create hrefs of their own 
		full token.</li>
	<li>Added an extra token for the clean URL next to 
		the href version of the Location</li>
	<li>Moved Event Settings out of Module Settings</li>
	<li>Added token for enrollment fee</li>
	<li>Added templating of Location column in list/day views</li>
	<li>Add edsettings to disable enrollment validation popup</li>
	<li>When a week-end day has events in Mont View No Cell Events, the 
		week-day style is applied to it. This was by design, but it ought to 
		have a seperate style to allow flexibility.</li>
	<li>Add RECURRINGEVENT/NOTRECURRINGEVNT tokens</li>
	<li>Add radio button to allow hiding of icon bar</li>
	<li>Adding the following tokens would be very helpful for providing a 
		more integrated experience:<br>[CREATEDBYID] - user ID of the person who 
		created the event<br>[OWNEDBYID] - user ID of the person who owns the 
		event<br>[UPDATEDBYID] - user ID of the person who last updated the 
		event</li>
	<li>Allow max length parameter in description token, 
		e.g. [event:description|150].</li>
	<li>Now the full range of tokens 
		is available to notifications</li>
	<li>Added token [IFTIMEZONEDISPLAY]</li>
	<li>Added HTML alternate text to .ics export to support Outlook</li>
	<li>Ability for sub 
		calendars to filter by category</li>
	<li>Is it now possible to pass the date through 
	the querystringso that the calendar does not default to today. 
		Add this to your URL: &quot;?eventdate=yyymmdd&quot;</li>
	<li>The Event Detail form can display the 
		Display Name as hyperlink which displays the User 
		Profile page when clicked, and also the email 
		address hyperlink to send a single email. </li>
</ul>
